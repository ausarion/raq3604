            <h1>What is Docker?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Docker is a containerization technology. It is required as a core skill you need know for DevOps,</p>
            <p>Programming, Security etc. Docker is a solution to servers, security patches, and dependencies</p>
            <p>that leads to intermittent errors. Dockers containers is the results. With Docker, you can manage</p>
            <p>your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. It takes the application, OS, all</p>
            <p>of its dependencies, configuration dependencies, and bundle all of this into an image.</p>
            <p>In Docker the OS is what is call the kernel. The kernel is basically the glue that </p>
            <p>connects the software to the hardware. Each application shares the memory of the OS.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated</p>
            <p>environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many</p>
            <p>containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain</p>
            <p>needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely everything on what is</p>
            <p>installed on the host.</p>

            <h1>What is a Docker registry?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public </p>
            <p>registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for</p>
            <P>images on Docker Hub by default. In Docker Hub is where you create a</p>
            <p>new repository.</P>
            <p>Here is my Docker Hub where I created three repositories.</p>
            <img src="/img/dockerhub.PNG" height="200"  width="500" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>When you use the "docker pull" or "docker run" commands, the required images</p>
            <p>are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command,</p>
            <p>your image is pushed to your configured registry.</p>
            <h1>What is a Docker container?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move,</p>
            <p>or delete  a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container </p>
            <p>to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on</p>
            <p>its current state.</p>
            <p>By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host</p>
            <p>machine. You can control how isolated a containerâ€™s network, storage, or other underlying</p>
            <p>subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.</p>
            <p>A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide</p>
            <p>to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state</p>
            <p>that are not stored in persistent storage disappear. A Dockerfile is a recipe for containers.</p>

            <h1>What are Docker commands</h1>
            <h1>using the command prompt?</h1>
            <br>
            <P>Docker focuses on three phases of images.</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Build</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
                <li>Run</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Dockerfile is used to build the image, it is a file with a list of commands</p>
            <p>that get sent to the Docker engine.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>How to build an image:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>"docker build --tag name of image", builds the image.</li>
                <li>"docker images", shows a list of images.</li>
                <li>"docker ps", shows current running image.</li>
                <li>Using the '-a' will show all images.</li>
                <li>"docker start tag name or image name", will start the container. </li>
                <li>"docker stop tag name or image name", will stop container.</li>
                <li>"docker logs name of container", show what logs are running.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>To run image:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>"docker run name of image", <h1 class="note">note: If it doesn't run it because docker runs in isolation</h1>
                <h1 class="note">from the rest of the system.</h1>
                <h1 class="note">You have to map to a port to connect to a network.</h1></li>
                <li>"docker run -d 'name of image' 8080:80"</li>
                <p>Inside the container returns a sha container ID.</p>
                <p>Now go to your browser and type localhost 8080:80 to see image of application.</p>
            </ul>
            <h1 class="note">To share image and push it out to Docker Hub:</h1>
            <p>Go to Docker Hub and create an account.</p>
            <p>Next, Create an repository by giving it a name (eg. xxxxx-xxxxx lowercase), then click create.</p>
            <p>"docker tag 'mame' 'name of repo'"</p>
            <p>"docker push 'name of repository'"</p>
            <h1 class="To remove and pull image:"></h1>
            <ul>
                <li>"docker rm 'name of repo'"</li>
                <li>"docker pull 'name of repo'"</li>
