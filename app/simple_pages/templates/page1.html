            <h2>What is Git?</h2>
            <p >Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs,</p>
            <p>Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and</p>
            <p>understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is</p>
            <p>the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as</p>
            <p>a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and</p>
            <p>so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each</p>
            <p>file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).</p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <h1>What is Git branch?</h1>
            <p>Git branch distinctly sets Git apart from other VCSs community.</p>
            <p>First you must understand that git stores data by a series of snapshots.</p>
            <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.</p>
            <p>The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given</p>
            <p>a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the </P>
            <P>master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To understand branch in Git begins with files that are modified and staged in your local repository.</p>
            <p>You must first initialize your local repository by typing "git init"</p>
            <p>This sets up the local repository for files to be added.</p>
            <p>The files are then staged to be added to your remote repository by typing the "git add ." command.</p>
            <p>By typing "git status" will show the files that have been modified and staged for commit</p>
            <p>in red text in your command prompt.</p>
            <p>The files are now ready to be committed by typing "git commit -m "write a short message"</p>
            <p>It is good practice to always type "git status " after each command to see the status.</p>
            <P>If there are no errors which all files will appear in green text to then be pushed to a branch.</P>
            <br>
        </div>
    </section>
     <div class="paragraph3">
         <h1>Creating a New Branch</h1>
         <p>The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch.</p>
         <p>The only reason nearly every repository has one is that the git init command creates it by</p>
         <p>default and most people don’t bother to change it.</p>
         <p>To create a new branch you must type "git branch 'name of branch'"</p>
         <p>As mentioned earlier branches are lightweight movable pointers to commits made.</p>
         <p>Branches are for developers after files have been modified and share those files by pushing</p></p>
         <p>them to a Github remote repository.</p>
         <br>
         <p>The "master" branch can be use for production of your app project</p>
         <p>and the other branches created can be for development and testing purposes.</p>
         <br>
         <h1>What is Git merge?</h1>
         <br>
         <p>Git merge joins two or more developement histories together when files have been modified since the</p>
         <p>since the last changes.</p>
         <p>Incorporates changes are made by commits since the last time their histories diverged from the current</p>
         <p>branch into current branch. The "git pull" command is used to integrate changes from another repository</p>
         <p>or branch into another branch.</p>
         <br>
         <h1>What is "git tag"?</h1>
         <p>You can create, list, delete, or verify a tag object with GPG.</p>
         <p>Tagging in Git or any other VCS, refers to a process of marking specific point in history for a repository</p>
         <p>containing a project. Basically, a reference point, a GPG sign tag object is created that will verify the user.</p>
